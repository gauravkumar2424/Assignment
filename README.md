- `find_mean`: Calculate the mean of an array.
- `find_maximum`: Find the maximum value in an array.
- `find_minimum`: Find the minimum value in an array.
- `find_median`: Find the median of an array.
- `sort_array`: Sort the array in ascending order.
- `print_statistics`: Print the statistical results.
